            Syntax.
        </h1>

        <p>A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. <br> On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.
            <br><br>
            The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation).<br> Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.
            <br><br>
            Programming language syntax is usually defined using a combination of regular expressions (for lexical structure) and Backusâ€“Naur form (for grammatical structure). Below is a simple grammar, based on Lisp:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    expression ::= atom | list
                </li>

                <li>
                    atom::= number | symbol
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    symbol::= ['A'-'Z''a'-'z'].* 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    number::= [+-]?['0'-'9']+
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    list::= '(' expression* ')'
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h3>
                This grammar specifies the following:
            </h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    an expression is either an atom or a list;
                </li>

                <li>
                    an atom is either a number or a symbol;
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    a number is an unbroken sequence of one or more decimal digits, optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign; 
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    a symbol is a letter followed by zero or more of any characters (excluding whitespace);
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    a list is a matched pair of parentheses, with zero or more expressions inside it.
                </li>

            </ul>

            Not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct. Many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed, per the language's rules; and may (depending on the language specification and the soundness of the implementation) result in an error on translation or execution.<br>In some cases, such programs may exhibit undefined behavior. Even when a program is well-defined within a language, it may still have a meaning that is not intended by the person who wrote it.
            <br><br>
           <b> Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false: </b>
           <br><br>"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." is grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning.<br>
            <br>"John is a married bachelor." is grammatically well-formed but expresses a meaning that cannot be true.<br>
           <br> <br> The following C language fragment is syntactically correct, but performs operations that are not semantically defined (the operation *p >> 4 has no meaning for a value having a complex type and p->im is not defined because the value of p is the null pointer):<br>

            complex *p = NULL;
            complex abs_p = sqrt(*p >> 4 + p->im);
            If the type declaration on the first line were omitted, the program would trigger an error on undefined variable "p" during compilation.<br> However, the program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information.
