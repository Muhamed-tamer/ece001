            The grammar needed to specify a programming language can be classified by its position in the Chomsky hierarchy.<br> The syntax of most programming languages can be specified using a Type-2 grammar, i.e., they are context-free grammars. <br> Some languages, including Perl and Lisp, contain constructs that allow execution during the parsing phase. Languages that have constructs that allow the programmer to alter the behavior of the parser make syntax analysis an undecidable problem,<br> and generally blur the distinction between parsing and execution.<br> In contrast to Lisp's macro system and Perl's BEGIN blocks, which may contain general computations, C macros are merely string replacements and do not require code execution.
